"""
    Dynamic programming solution for finding n-th Fibonacci member:
        • F0 = 0
        • F1 = 1
        ▪ Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
        ▪ Memoization → save/cache sub-problem solutions for later use
        ▪ Typically using an array, matrix or a hash table
    Recursive Fibonacci has ~ O(1.6n) complexity.
    Recursive Fibonacci (with memorization) has ~ O(n) complexity.
    If we want to find the 36-th Fibonacci number:
        ▪ Recursive solution takes 48 315 633 steps
        ▪ Iterative or recursive (with memorization) takes ~36 steps
