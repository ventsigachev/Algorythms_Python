"""
    Given a list of strings, write a program that returns the longest string chain that can be built from those strings.
    A string chain is defined as follows: subsequence of a given sequence in which the subsequence's elements
    are in sorted order (string length), lowest to highest, and in which the subsequence is as long as possible.
    If several sequences with equal length exist, find the left-most of them.
