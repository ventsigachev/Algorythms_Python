"""
    We are in a rectangular room. On opposite sides of the room, there are sets of n cables (n < 1000). The cables are
    indexed from 1 to n. On each side of the room, there is a permutation of the cables,
    e.g. on one side we always have ordered {1, 2, 3, 4, 5},
    and on the other side, we have some permutation {5, 1, 3, 4, 2}.
    We are trying to connect each cable from one side with the corresponding cable on the other side â€“
    connect 1 with 1, 2 with 2, etc. The cables are straight and should not overlap!
    The task is to find the maximum number of pairs we can connect given the restrictions above.
