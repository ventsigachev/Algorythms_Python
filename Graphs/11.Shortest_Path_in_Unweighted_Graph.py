    You will be given a graph from the console.
    Your task is to find the shortest path and print it back on the console.
    The first line will be the number of Nodes - N, the second one - the number of Edges - E,
    then on each E line - the edge in form {destination} â€“ {source}.
    On the last two lines, you will read the start node and the end node.

    The better solution is to use breath-first search(BTF).
