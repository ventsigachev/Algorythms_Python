   The task is to find the shortest path in a graph from S vertex to D vertex.
   However, edges might have negative weights.
   Input
    • On the first line, you will receive an integer – n – number of nodes.
    • On the second line, you will receive an integer – e – number of edges.
    • On the next e lines, you will receive edges in the following format: "{source} {destination} {weight}".
    • On the next line, you will receive an integer – source – the start of the path.
    • On the last line, you will receive an integer – destination – end of the path.
